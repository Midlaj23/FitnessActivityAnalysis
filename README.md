Fitness Activity Analysis using python

Uncover insights at the intersection of smartwatches and fitness with this project. Analysing user data to reveal trends and patterns, it sheds light on the evolving landscape of wearable technology.

# Project Components

**Data Source :** CSV file

**Notebook :** Google colab

**Data Visualization :** Plotly

# Findings

**Most Inactive Day :** Day of the week with lease activity.

**Most Active Day :** Day of the week with Highest activity.

**Most Active Individual :** Pinpointing the user with the highest overall activity level.

**Above-Average Active Days :** Days where total steps exceed the average.

**Below-Average Active Days :** Days where total steps fall below the average.

# Conclusion


In this Fitness Activity Analysis project, we explored user data from smartwatches using Python in Google Colab. By leveraging a CSV file and visualizing data with Plotly, we uncovered some interesting findings. We identified the day of the week with the least activity, labeling it as the "Most Inactive Day," and pinpointed the day with the highest activity as the "Most Active Day." Additionally, we determined the individual with the highest overall activity level, crowning them the "Most Active Individual." This analysis not only sheds light on the trends in wearable technology but also helps users understand their fitness patterns. The findings can be valuable for individuals looking to optimize their activity levels and for the broader context of evolving trends in the world of fitness and smartwatches. The entire project and findings can be explored in the provided Google Colab notebook
