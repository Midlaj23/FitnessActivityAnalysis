# Conclusion

we've discovered some interesting trends. It turns out that individuals tend to purchase only around half of the items they initially add to their online shopping carts. Moreover, there are notable gender differences, with men exhibiting a higher purchase rate and constituting the majority of online browsers. Mobile devices, especially phones, play a significant role in online browsing, capturing the most time spent exploring products. Regionally, Delhi leads in actual purchases, while Kolkata stands out for the duration people spend browsing. Interestingly, age also influences online behavior, as young women aged 18 tend to browse and purchase the most, while for men, it's 29-year-olds browsing and 18, 21, and 22-year-olds making the most purchases. Understanding these patterns can assist businesses in tailoring their online shopping experiences to better meet the preferences and habits of their customers.
